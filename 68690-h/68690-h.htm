<p>The theory advanced by Prof. I. N. Vail accounts for the formation of
the earth’s crust, with its associated minerals, in the fact that it was once
surrounded by rings of aqueous vapor, containing much of its present
solid matter, which fell as mighty deluges. The last of these rings descended
at the time of the Noachian deluge and caused that catastrophe,
which is so graphically described by Moses, and which tradition has sung
in the ears of every tribe of Adam’s race. The formation of these rings
was caused by the intense heat, which drove to an immense distance every
substance which could be reduced to vapor, and where they formed as
annular bands or rings similar to those surrounding the planet Saturn at
the present time. After long ages the portion nearest the earth slowly
overcanopied the heavens, and owing to the lack of centrifugal force
began its descent at the poles.</p>

<p>This theory explains certain phenomena better than any other yet advanced
by scientists. It accounts for the uplift of mountains; the deposit
of coal and other minerals; the glacial age; the retardation of the moon,
and it alone explains much contained in the first eight chapters of Genesis.</p>

<p>Prof. Vail has published a volume of about 400 pages on this subject,
which for clearness of statement and logical conclusions has seldom been
equaled by previous writers on scientific subjects. He deals in convincing
facts which are destined to overturn many pre-conceived theories in the
science of geology.</p>

<p>My object in sending forth this pamphlet is to call the attention of intelligent
readers to a theory which must engage the attention of scientists
in the future, and which will enable the geologist to make clear many
things which are now obscure. I respectfully ask for the following pages
a candid reading, and for further information on the subject refer the
reader to Prof. Vail’s “Story of the Rocks”, and to other works of the
gifted author, which are now passing through the press.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="IMPORTANCE_OF_THE_QUESTION">IMPORTANCE OF THE QUESTION.</h3>


<p>Jupiter’s belts are doubtless aqueous
vapor driven from that planet
by heat; similar in every respect,
probably, to the primitive condition
of our globe. This vapor would
not all fall at once on the cooling of
the earth, but the upper portion
would continue to revolve for a long
period.</p>

<p>All geologists agree that the earth
was once in an igneous fluid state,
and during that condition all of its
waters and whatever else could be
vaporized and sublimed by heat, as
the less refractory metals and minerals,
were driven away from its surface.
The foundation of the Annular
System was the molten or igneous
world. The vaporized water,
mineral and metallic elements repelled
from it existed as a great vaporized
atmosphere that rotated with
the earth.</p>

<p>If the earth then rotated once in
twenty-four hours, so did the atmosphere.
Proctor and some others
claim that the earth then rotated in
three hours; if so, the atmosphere
did the same. No matter how long
or how short the period of the
earth’s rotation, the upper vapors rotated
with it. Then, when and how
did these vapors and other materials
composing the atmosphere return to
the earth? Geologists generally
have claimed that they fell at the
close of the igneous period; but the
Annular Theory claims that they did
not, and it undertakes to explain the
phenomena of the geologic ages and
epochs upon this claim.</p>

<p>The most eminent scientists agree
that the vapors were driven off at
least 200,000 miles from the earth,
and many claim a distance of 240,000
miles. All of the carbon in the
grand casement of aqueous rocks,
the vast oceans of oxygen now contained
in the silicates, sulphates, carbonates
and oxides of the crust, as
well as the nitrogen and hydrogen
in numerous compounds enormously
swelled its volume. But the Annular
Theory will claim but 100,000
miles as the atmosphere and that the
earth rotated as now, once in twenty-four
hours. At the equator it
revolves at the rate of 1,000 miles
an hour, at which rate the periphery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
of the earth’s primitive atmosphere
would revolve more than 25,000
miles an hour.</p>

<p>Now it is mathematically certain
that a body in our atmosphere revolving
at the rate of 17,500 miles
an hour could not fall to the earth’s
surface. By Kepler’s “Third Law”
we can readily demonstrate not only
that these vapors were thrown out
into a ring system, but how far beyond
the earth they reached, namely:
“The squares of the periodic
times of revolving satellites are proportioned
to the cubes of their
mean distances from the primary
around which they move.”</p>

<p>The vapors nearest the earth did
not possess the energy of satellites,
consequently they fell to the earth,
as the latter’s surface cooled, leaving
the more distant matter moving independently
above it.</p>


<h3>EVIDENCES OF THE GEOLOGIC RECORD.</h3>

<p>When the earth was in a state of
fiery fluidity, all of the water it
now contains was suspended at a
great distance above it. Beside the
oceans which now cover three-fourths
of the surface of the globe,
rocks and coals contain from ten
per cent to one half water, all of
which was primarily held in suspension.
The bosom of the earth is
continually absorbing water as is
demonstrated by deep mines and
other excavations. Dana estimates
that even if the crust of the earth
is but five miles thick that the
oceans would be 400 feet deeper if
all of the earth’s imbibed waters
could be returned to them. But
the earth’s crust is more likely to be
100 miles thick, and it has been imbibing
these waters for millions of
years if not millions of ages. This
would increase the oceans to about
8000 feet deeper than now. Yet
oceans are much deeper today than
they were in geologic times.</p>

<p>This great mass of vapor would
rotate by centrifugal force at the
equator, but there being no such
force at the poles it was there kept
from falling by heat alone. If
the earth had not rotated the
vapors would have occupied great
heights; but centrifugal force being
aided by actual rotation they
were driven much farther. These
forces necessarily drove the vapors
over the equator. If, however, any
vapors were left at the poles they
must have fallen when the earth
cooled down.</p>

<p>At that age rolled the first born
ocean around the globe. Clouds
formed, rain descended, and winds
swept the earth. There was summer
and winter, and day and night.</p>

<p>The centripetal force of the
rings was gradually retarded by the
influence of the moon, and the gravital
force was increased until the
rings spread over the earth or approached
it. When the innermost
ring gradually descended toward
the earth and came in contact with
the air it was checked, and necessarily
spread out toward the poles.
Gravital force is strongest in the
polar regions. If the rings of Saturn
and Jupiter could increase
their motion they would rise to
greater heights. If they could become
slower they would sink toward
the poles.</p>


<h3>EVIDENCE FROM OTHER PLANETS.</h3>

<p>We have never seen the actual
face of Saturn, and the sun is never
visible to its inhabitants. It is a
planet upon which there is probably
perpetual day. The belts are composed
of the same kind of material<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
as the super-crust of the earth—silicious,
calcareous and carbonaceous
matter. They will in time
become a part of the planet’s sedimentary
formation.</p>

<p>When the inveterate fires of the
sun shall have died out, forms of
carbon and associated forms of
aqueous and mineral matter will
form an annular system around it.</p>

<p>A burning world must be a smoking
world, and from its furnaces
must arise vast volumes of unconsumed
carbon to mingle with suspended
vapors.</p>

<p>When Saturn’s rings fall to the
body of the planet its moons will
necessarily retire a little farther
from it. Astronomers say that our
moon is gradually retiring from the
earth. Then it must have had an
annular system which fell and
caused the moon to recede.</p>


<h3>FURTHER EXAMINATION OF THE RECORD.</h3>

<p>The vapors contained silex, quartz
and whatever else was vaporized
and suspended therein. After the
atmosphere had cooled it deposited
on the earth what it contained when
heated. Much of the sedimentary
beds built upon the Laurentian and
older rocks were simply precipitated
from the annular system.</p>

<p>Iron and sulphur existed in the
upper ocean as metallic and mineral
salts. In the cooling process the
heavier minerals and metals would
necessarily locate nearest the earth
and be the first to fall. True they
were disseminated to a certain extent
throughout the system.</p>

<p>Iron and other heavy metals
formed beds in the sea bottom.
Iron from Iron Mountain, Mo.,
and Pilot Knob, also lead and copper
ores are in the Laurentian rocks.
These rocks are aqueous or sedimentary.
The annular matter fell but
in small part in equatorial regions,
but largely in temperate and frigid
zones.</p>

<p>It is folly to suppose that all the
matter of aqueous beds were deposited
from previous aqueous beds by
denudation. How were subsequent
lime deposits made from silicious
Archaean beds? Denudation has
taken place in all ages, and a fall
and precipitation of exotic matter—tellurio-cosmic
matter—aided in
the work.</p>


<h3>CONCLUSIONS REACHED.</h3>

<p>1. All terrestial waters were
held in suspension.</p>

<p>2. This rotated as a part and
parcel of the earth—a primeval
atmosphere of great complexity of
material.</p>

<p>3. This suspended matter gathered
in the earth’s equatorial heavens,
and on condensing contracted
and segregated into rings which
revolved independently.</p>

<p>4. The waters on high fell in a
succession of stupendous cataclysms.</p>

<p>5. The first ocean was impregnated
with mineral and metallic
salts.</p>

<p>6. It required a vast lapse of
time for rings to fall. Each ring
continued to revolve as a belt about
the earth with a decreasing velocity
as it spread toward the poles and
overcanopied the earth.</p>

<p>7. The smoke or unconsumed
carbon that arose from the earth,
darkened the upper vapors and
formed bands or belts.</p>

<p>8. The moon retarded the rings,
causing them to fall upon the earth,
and it then receded from our planet.</p>

<p>9. The Archaean metalliferous
deposits are so located as to be inexplicable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
by the old theory of
aqueous denudation.</p>

<p>10. The Silurian beds, and particularly
the order of their occurrence
utterly refutes the idea that
they were derived from pre-existing
beds.</p>


<h3>DEMONSTRATED BY HISTORIC TESTIMONY.</h3>

<p>In Gen. 1:7 God made the firmament
and divided the waters
which were under the firmament
from the waters which were above
the firmament. According to the
Hebrew the atmosphere became an
expanse between two bodies of
waters, and of course the upper
stratum had to move round the
earth. In Gen. 1:3,4 light came in
and garnished the heavens before
the sun was seen.</p>

<p>In the 10th. verse the waters on
the earth were called seas, the water
above the earth was called the deep,
and the Spirit of God moved upon
them. “And God said, Let there be
light,” and light came upon the
deep.</p>

<p>In Gen 1:14-19 the sun which
existed for ages did not appear in
the heavens until after the sun
brought forth grass, etc. Then it is
plain that some intercepting canopy
cut off the direct rays of the sun.</p>

<p>The writer of Genesis did not say
the sun and moon shone upon the
earth, but he does say the stars did
this. According to the Vailan
theory this is true, but they shone
in from polar regions.</p>

<p>The earth’s surface was not heated
by the sun’s direct rays, but under
the overcanopying vapors it must
have been warmed, and its temperature
equalized by transmitted and
diffused solar heat.</p>


<h3>CONCLUSIONS.</h3>

<p>There was a green-house temperature
all over the earth at this time.
Storms and tempests were unknown,
as such phenomena are caused by
sun-power, sun-heat falling directly
upon the earth. Rains were infrequent,
if at all.</p>

<p>Man, in the day when solar actinism
was shorn of its strength,
must have experienced remarkable
longevity, for upon solar energy
depends every form and phaze of
life on earth.</p>

<p>The day of rest referred to in
Gen. 2:3 in which God ceased from
his labors was a windless, stormless,
rainless, winterless age; for immediately
we are told that “God had
not caused it to rain upon the
earth.” The climate was warm for
man dwelt naked upon the earth.
He was nurtured in a green-house
world.</p>

<p>The rainbow comes into view
after the deluge for the first time.
There could have been neither rain
nor sunshine previously, just what
the Vailan theory claims. The
wind came upon the earth after the
waters of the deluge had fallen, and
not before.</p>

<p>It was after the deluge that God
said, “While the earth remaineth
seed-time and harvest, and cold and
heat, and summer and winter, and
day and night shall not cease.” The
period before the flood was nightless,
and evening and morning were
day; that is, they coalesced into one
period called day.</p>

<p>After the deluge the bow is given;
man’s longevity declines; the winds
come, and alternating seasons take
place—all pointing to the fact that
the antedeluvian world was overcanopied
by annular waters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>Every leaf of the geologic record
declares that the world has been
deluged time and again, which this
theory also claims to be true, and to
have taken place at the declension
of each ring or stratum.</p>


<h3>THE NOACHIAN DELUGE.</h3>

<p>There is enough water now on
the earth and in its rocky frame to
make an hundred terrific deluges,
every one of which could drown the
world of living beings.</p>

<p>In early days man believed there
was a great deep on high. The
sources of the deluge were “broken
up,” and never again can the world
be destroyed from that source. If
the fountains of the deep were on
the earth or in the seas then they
are not “broken up.” If they were
in the clouds, they were not, for that
source still exists. Then we must
believe that they came from beyond
the clouds.</p>

<p>With the fountain of the great
deep placed on high—the veritable
waters above the firmament—we can
readily understand why the “windows
of heaven were opened,” and
why “all the fountains of the great
deep were broken up.” The rainbow
proclaims these facts around
the circuit of the earth.</p>

<p>How does it happen that the
author of Genesis relates these facts
with such harmonious accord, with
all the conditions which an Annular
arrangement of water necessitated,
if the idea was not familiar to his
mind?</p>

<p>The presence of upper vapors entering
the atmosphere on their way
to the earth by the way of the polar
regions necessitated an atmosphere
of greater buoyancy and power, and
this necessitated greater bodily
frame. Hence it is said: “There
were giants in those days.” There
were giants among animals as well
as men.</p>


<h3>LEGENDS OF THE DELUGE.</h3>

<p>Such wide-spread desolation as is
accredited to the deluge of Noah
must have made an indelible impression
upon the human mind.
We would naturally look for references
to it in Aryan, Phoenecian,
Greek and Hebrew history. They
were the guardians of civilization.
It is not difficult to co-link even the
rudest form of the flood traditions
with the terrible visitation so graphically
related by Moses. Its shadow
will never pass from the historic
page.</p>

<p>Men may criticise and ridicule
the narrative given by Moses, yet
the fact remains that a self-sustaining
history is there; and the combined
sophistry of all time cannot
shake it.</p>

<p>An account of that great catastrophe
is found in the mythological
narratives and traditional history of
nearly or quite every people and
tribe of Adam’s race.</p>

<p>It is found among the Egyptians,
Chaldeans, Greeks, Scythians and
Celtic tribes. It has been discovered
among the Peruvians and Mexicans;
the aborigines of Cuba, of
North America and the South Sea
Islands. Even the inhabitants of
Alaska preserve a tradition of the
deluge; and all point unmistakably
to the deluge of Noah.</p>

<p>Recent investigations in the ruins
of Nineveh, Babylon and in ancient
cities of Egypt confirm it by tablets
preserved as veritable books.</p>

<p>Tradition as she sits amidst the
crumbling ages of the past sings it
in our ears, while the sound of a universal
deluge has gone out through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
all the earth. It would require volumes
to present these traditions
alone.</p>


<h3>AUGMENTATION OF OCEANIC WATERS.</h3>

<p>Some portions of the earth are
sinking while others are rising. The
millions of cubic feet of matter deposited
daily in the oceans by rivers
would be sufficient to accomplish
this. Every pound of matter thus
transferred, <em>is an energy transferred</em>.
In the course of 1,000 years, 1,000
square miles of oceanic bottom
would be covered to the depth of
240 feet.</p>

<p>This enormous pressure on the
underlying rocks is so much transferred
energy converted into
mechanical heat. This must expand
the rocks thus under increased
pressure. If this sediment
were not borne into the ocean
along the Atlantic coast and spread
out over vast areas it would be
lined with mountains and volcanoes,
as that of the Mediterranean sea;
but being spread out over an extensive
floor it prevents their formation
by lateral pressure.</p>

<p>Volcanoes are located where sediments
can accumulate, and are
doubtless the result of this accumulation.
Sixty-five thousand feet of
steel blocks piled one upon another
would cause sufficient heat to melt
the lower ones or reduce them to a
plastic state. The lava that issues
from a volcano is the deep bed-rock
fused by pressure produced by
lateral expansion. Accumulating
sediments cause rock expansion in
some regions, and being removed
from others, causes contraction.
Expansion elevates the earth’s crust;
contraction lowers it.</p>

<p>A downfall of water that would
raise the ocean fifty feet above its
present level would cause an expansion
that no rocks could resist,
and its lateral pressure must result
in mountain making. The New
England coast has been elevated in
comparatively recent times. The
St. Lawrence is so new that it has
not yet swept its channel clean.</p>

<p>From Nova Scotia to Florida and
around the whole boundary of the
Gulf of Mexico are the submerged
shore-lines of a former continent.
Many miles out the lead-line suddenly
plunges from about 100 fathoms
to from 200 to 1,500 fathoms.
So around the British Isles, the
coast of Norway, and that of Northern
Europe and Asia. South America,
Africa and the Pacific present
the same characteristics. The
course of a submerged continent has
been traced in mid-ocean.</p>


<h3>SUMMARY.</h3>

<p>The Vailan Theory is proved,</p>

<p>1. By mathematical reasoning
and philosophic necessity.</p>

<p>2. By the mineral character and
philosophical deposition of strata.</p>

<p>3. By analagous facts relating to
other worlds, belted and ringed
under the reign of law.</p>

<p>4. By the action of the moon.</p>

<p>5. By the records of man whose
ancient writings declare, and re-declare,
again and again, the truth
of this claim. The first eight chapters
of Genesis alone afford proof
sufficient if all else failed.</p>

<p>6. The waters on the earth themselves
declare the fact.</p>


<h3>GEOGRAPHICAL FEATURES.</h3>

<p>The first and most important element
of the earth’s crust is carbon.
Of the more than 60,000 feet of
aqueous beds there are probably
none that it does not enter into as
an important factor. It was first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
driven from the earth by intense
heat. The burning world was a
smoking world. The unconsumed
carbon commingled with the Annular
vapors in the form of black,
sooty, pitchy matter. This was deposited
at the time of the deluge,
and the waters that stood in seas,
lakes and ponds deposited it as a
layer of black, carbonaceous mud
upon their bottoms. It may be
found in ten thousand lakes planted
in the Drift deposits in North America
and Northern Europe.</p>

<p>A black carbonaceous soil covers
many Western States which were
once covered by a vast inland sea.
This sea was bounded on the west
by the Rocky Mountains; south by
the Ozark Mountains and the mountains
of Tennessee and Kentucky,
and emptied its waters into Lake
Michigan.</p>

<p>This great inland sea finally became
a fresh-water body. The remains
of the mastodon, mammoth
and other pachyderms of interdiluvian
times, as well as fresh-water shells are found. It made
for itself two great outlets, the
Mississippi and the St. Lawrence
rivers. This inland sea must have
been elevated 700 or 800 feet above
the ocean, and was surrounded on
all sides by walls, and covered an
area of at least 500,000 square
miles. We must conclude that
some great down-rush of waters
caused it to break its bounds in two
directions at the same time.</p>

<p>The fall of waters supplied the
black, sooty carbon that settled to
the bottom of the sea, remaining
but a few inches thick on the hills,
perhaps, but several feet in the
valleys, and is the source of the
peat bogs.</p>


<h3>GLACIAL EPOCHS.</h3>

<p>Previous to the glacial record
there had closed a long period of
perpetual spring. The primitive
elephant, and many of his congeners
and contemporaries, fed in luxurious
forests and grassy plains toward
the north pole, which are now covered
with glaciers grinding their
bones to dust. Northern regions
which for untold ages had been covered
with tropical vegetation, and
animals of innumerable forms, began
to be invaded by glaciers which
slowly made their way toward the
equator.</p>

<p>The only way glaciers are now
formed is by vapors wafted over
them from adjacent lands warmed
by solar heat; but they were not
formed that way during the glacial
epochs, but by the declension of annular
vapors. Glacial ice cannot
accumulate extensively now. <em>It
flows</em>, and cannot be heaped up
largely, its rate of motion being proportionate
to the slope of its bed.
The source of those snows which
built a great continental ice cap
over the northern hemisphere must
be attributed to the Annular System.
They accumulated in the St. Lawrence
valley several thousand feet
thick and towered over the New
England mountains.</p>

<p>Snow seldom falls in arctic regions
now. Dr. Kane saw sledge
tracks that were made several years
previously. How then did those
boundless reaches of snow and ice
accumulate but by the descent of
Annular vapors?</p>

<p>Animals are found entombed in
the frozen soil and snows under the
arctic circle. For many years a
large trade has been carried on in
ivory, by Siberian traders, dug from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
the frozen soil. Many of the animals,
as the mammoth, rhinoceros,
etc., remain undecayed, and in their
stomachs and between their teeth
are found the vegetation upon
which they fed. And even the capillary
blood vessels still retaining
their contents, showing that there
was not the slightest decomposition,
but that the catastrophe which overwhelmed
them was sudden. The
climate was changed as by a stroke,
which congealed and sealed the land
in ice, locking the mammoth and
other animals therein.</p>

<p>Had those animals not been frozen
soon as killed, putrification and decomposition
must have taken place.
Nothing but the down-rush of snows
from the earth’s Annular System
could have done this. These remains
are dredged from the northern
oceans, and they are also found
fossilized over large portions of Siberia;
in both cases being doubtless
dropped from icebergs. The mammoth
is found frozen in a glacier;
the glacier was originally snow; the
destruction must necessarily have
been sudden.</p>

<p>If not more than one tenth of the
waters now upon the earth had fallen
in the form of snow it would
have covered the entire land surface
of the globe more than 30,000 feet
deep; and as one tenth must have
fallen in polar regions it brings out
the Annular Theory as a competent
source. The sudden fall of snow
sufficient to overwhelm a semi-tropical
world could not accumulate in
the atmosphere as it now does, and
fall therefrom. It must have come
from a source beyond the atmosphere.</p>

<p>The overcanopying fund of vapors
acted as a mighty robe to the earth,
keeping out the cold of space, and
equally distributing solar heat over
the globe and causing terrestial
warmth. The animals were much
larger than their representatives are
now, showing that the atmosphere
was heavier and possessed more
buoyant power by the pressure of a
vast ocean of vapors in the higher
regions.</p>

<p>The downfall of water caused continual
upheavals, and mountain
making, which is proved by finding
marine fossils along the seashore,
and elsewhere far above the ocean.
Terraces of the Champlain epoch in
New England that must have been
formed in the sea, are now found
elevated hundreds of feet.</p>

<p>All geologists agree that there
have been many floods upon the
earth. The great telluric glaciers of
recent geologic times were melted
under the tropic influence of the Annular
vapors resulting in deluges.</p>

<p>Under the vast pressure of the
accumulated waters the plastic
ocean bed goes down and forces its
foundation under the continent by
lateral pressure, and causes upturned
and crumpled strata in many places,
and also volcanic phenomena.</p>


<h3>REVIEW OF THE GEOLOGIC RECORD.</h3>

<p>The geologist has never yet found
the base of the aqueous rocks, nor
can he know how deep their foundations
extend. When the Laurentian
stratified beds were formed
there was an ocean on the earth. A
portion of the tellurio-cosmic waters
had fallen.</p>

<p>In the boulder and conglomerate
rocks found in every age of geology
there is proof that glaciers invaded
the earth after the declension of
each Annular stratum. The Annular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
matter extended in comparatively
narrow belts over the equator. As
the lower stratum was attracted toward
the earth it gradually spread
out toward the polar regions, causing
a warm climate all over the
earth, and melting the snows and
glaciers at the poles. This
lasted untold ages until a tropic
and semi-tropical vegetation spread
over the earth. After its fall arctic
cold invaded the north and south
poles, pushing a vast ice cap toward
the equator, which remained until
another stratum of annular vapors
spread over the globe. These ages
of warmth and ages of cold continued
to alternate until the fall of the
last ring of vapors, which took place
at the time of the Noachian deluge,
causing that catastrophe.</p>

<p>The sudden destruction of life, at
the end of each age in geology,
must have been caused by sudden
cold. The waters reaching the
earth at the poles must cause refrigeration;
must cause excessive
floods; must cause extermination of
specific forms of life; must cause new
distribution and condition of oceanic
waters, and caused great folding
and crumpling of strata.</p>

<p>In the dissolving of glaciers a vast
pressure was lifted from the continents
and transferred to the ocean
beds, causing them to go down and
the land to be elevated.</p>


<h3>SEED BED OF ORGANISMS.</h3>

<p>From the days of Homer until the
present time we read of dust-storms
of living organisms falling upon the
earth, and colored snow, the coloring
matter being microscopic forms
of life. The dust is doubtless of
cosmic origin. There must be micro-cosmic
clouds moving in interplanetary
space, which meeting the
earth in its path, are precipitated
upon its surface.</p>

<p>We can scarcely conceive of matter
anywhere without associating it
with living forms. The outermost
vapors of the annular system, which
fell in the time of Noah, remained
on high for unknown millions of
years, receiving constant additions
of meteoric and cosmic dust from
without. As the gaseous envelope
that now surrounds our earth contains
living organisms, we must believe
the annular matter did also,
and to a much greater degree.</p>

<p>If Jupiter’s belted system had
long ago descended to the body of
that planet, so that we could gaze
upon the continents and seas as we
do those of Mars, we would conclude
that they swarmed with life. An
incomplete world must contain incomplete
or primordial life-forms;
forms that in time must develop.
In yellow snow, dust showers, “blood
rains,” etc. we have evidence that
organic forms are natural accompaniments
of the nebulous and elementary
forms of matter.</p>

<p>Spider showers are well authenticated.
Sometimes the air is filled
with their gossamer threads upon
which they mount to unknown depths
of space, where they live. If spiders
can live in the air, descend to the
earth and live there for a time, and
toads can live for untold ages immured
in solid rock, they could live
in belts of aqueous and mineral
matter. The manner in which organisms
have succeeded each other
on the earth as revealed by the geologic
records demands that the annular
system was the cradle of infant
life, the propagating beds in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
which the life-germs were placed by
the great Gardener of Nature.</p>

<p>It is as reasonable to suppose that
germs took form in water under the
creative hand before they fell to the
earth as afterward, and when we see
that each downfall brought new
life-forms which exhibit no specific
or generic relation to previous
forms, we are forced to admit that
either the seed beds of the Annular
system provided the undeveloped
organisms, or there was a special
creation at each period.</p>

<p>In the Silurian age there was an
ocean containing heavy calcarious
matter; in the Devonian silicious
and silicio-calcarious matter; in the
Carboniferous carbonaceous matter,
and each ocean had its characteristic
life-forms. But if all the
waters fell at one time, how is it
possible for each age to have had
an ocean containing characteristic
minerals? These characteristic minerals
fell with each ring, which
marked the ages of geology, destroying
previous life-forms and introducing
new ones. Eozoic rocks
were laid down 40,000 feet thick.
Upon these were piled Silurian 65,000
feet thick; on these Devonian
rocks 15,000 feet, and then comes
17,000 feet of Carboniferous rocks,
each age having characteristic fossils
and mineral deposits. As these
deposits were laid down by the sea,
why do they so widely differ in their
composition if they all fell at the
same time from above! The Potsdam
sandstone underlies the Silurian
rocks. It spread from the Canadas
to Texas, from the Alleghanies
to the Rocky mountains, and probably
forms a casement around the
globe. It is 8,000 feet thick, and
shows a mechanical and rapid accumulation,
pointing unmistakably to
the downfall of a silicious ring.</p>

<p>The Annular theory admits of the
universal eroding power of rivers
and waves; the transporting power
of currents and strata building from
detrital matter. But waves can do
nothing unless supplied with matter.
Where did they get the crystalline,
granulated and infusorial matter to
spread over the floor of the Silurian
ocean? Great beds of metals have
been laid down as regularity stratified
deposits which could not have
been borne from Archaean terranes.</p>


<h3>CARBON STRATA DEPOSITED AS AN AQUEOUS
SEDIMENT.</h3>

<p>Carbon composing a peat bed is
simply unconsumed carbon. The
carbon or smoke that arises from
every chimney and furnace when
measurably shut up from immediate
union with oxygen, remains an unburnt
fuel precisely the same in
kind as the unburnt carbon fuel of
the peat bogs. Were we to collect
the unburnt carbon from our chimneys
in piles, where moisture and
air could have free access, it would
take fire spontaneously and burn,
just as peat dug from the bog sometimes
takes fire and burns.</p>

<p>The millions of fires from foundries,
volcanoes, etc., are forming
fuel wherever soot is formed, and
were it not for the ever active oxygen
of the air, it would all descend
upon the earth as fuel and become
incorporated in forming sedimentary
beds. This is our claim for the
coal, which as unconsumed carbon
arose beyond the reach of destroying
oxygen, from the heated, glowing
furnace of our globe, and in
time returned to the earth.</p>

<p>When the plant dies and begins<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
to decay one of its constituent elements,
carbon, oxydizes by slow
combustion and returns to the air
as an invisible gas. It is but accidental
when a particle fails to become
oxydized and remains as unconsumed
carbon. An exceedingly
small part of vegetation remains unburnt.</p>

<p>Coal veins, which are from one
foot to three hundred feet thick,
would make a stratum around the
earth ten feet thick. Fifty pounds
of coal will yield 10,000 gallons of
carbonic acid. Then calling eight
gallons equal to one cubic foot the
astonishing fact comes out that the
coal beds actually draw from the
atmosphere an ocean of carbonic
acid which would have covered the
globe to the depth of 12,500 feet,
which would have destroyed all animal
life. Even three or four per
cent. of carbonic acid in our present
atmosphere would be fatal to animal
life. Hence it is clear that
coal cannot be attributed to vegetable
origin.</p>


<h3>CONCLUSIONS REACHED.</h3>

<p>The following conclusions are
clearly deducible:</p>

<p>1. The Annular system was a region
of microscopic life and infusorial
forms. Coal being deposited
by sea-water carried down with it
marine forms, and others settled
upon its surface.</p>

<p>2. The carbon deposits must
have borne down a vast amount of
marine vegetation and buried it
upon the sea bottom. In swamp
marshes the vegetation would have
been entirely different.</p>

<p>3. When a carbon fall was borne
to the seas and settled where limestone
strata prevailed it would indicate
great distance from the shore,
and here the roof shales of the
coal must be necessarily free from
land fossils. Coal beds amongst
sandstone strata indicate depositions
near shore, and may contain land
fossils.</p>

<p>4. The coal beds must be more
heavily developed toward polar regions,
and most free from impurities.</p>

<p>5. All carbon downfalls must
have been attended by great cataclysms
of snow, or water, or both.</p>

<p>6. A coal vein deposited near a
volcano, or mechanical heat arising
therefrom would be metamorphosed
into heavier and harder forms of
carbon. But as all grades must
have existed in the Annular system
as primitive distillates, all of these
forms may be found in lands where
no strata disturbance has taken
place.</p>

<p>7. The heavy carbon, as the anthracite
and semi-bituminous particles
would be borne to the deep
seas, while the lighter would float
into shallow water. Hence a submarine
valley might have a deposit
of anthracite while a neighboring
bed on an elevation might be bituminous.</p>

<p>8. In both northern and southern
hemispheres the coal must be
more valuable as we proceed from
the equator.</p>

<p>9. There must have been carbon
falls in all ages, and the first were
the purest and the best, while the
last to descend must have been the
lightest and poorest, and must be
found near the surface, or are the
foundations of recent peat bogs.</p>

<p>Peat vegetation, or moss known
by the generic name of <em>Sphagnous</em>,
has led many to believe it to be the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
origin of that product. But these
<em>sphagnous</em> mosses could never have
planted themselves over the medial
and colder latitudes if the carbon
beds necessary to sustain them had
not previously been planted there.
If coal and peat are vegetable products
they should exist in greater
abundance in tropical regions; but
they are found in limited quantity
there.</p>


<h3>IS COAL A VEGETABLE PRODUCT?</h3>

<p>The usually accepted theory concerning
the origin of coal is that it
was formed from an ancient vegetation
that grew largely in peat and
swamp marshes. This theory the
Vailan system overthrows.</p>

<p>Every atom of the great mass of
carbon now forming the coal deposits
must have been a distilled
product of a primitive igneous process
before the plant could possibly
appropriate it. Every intelligent
chemist knows that the great telluric
gas furnace of primitive times
was competent to produce all the
carbon now found in the crust of
the earth. Soot, that sometimes
takes fire in our chimneys, is deposited
in infinitesimal smoke particles.
Hence, smoke from burning
carbon is simply a fuel which makes
it evident that the smoke which
arose from the igneous earth was a
fuel hydro-carbon. The dark belts
of Saturn and Jupiter are doubtless
strata of carbon revolving about
those planets.</p>

<p>If the Vailan theory is true the
graphites and heavier forms of carbon
were the first to fall upon the
earth after the igneous period was
passed, and will be found in its
first aqueous beds, and generally
unassociated with fossil vegetation.
This is precisely what we do find.
Both Dana and Dawson bear testimony
to the fact that graphite is a
very common mineral in the older
beds, and that the primitive carbon
beds are equal in gravity to that of
similar areas in the carboniferous
system.</p>

<p>Why no fossil plants in the earlier
coal deposits? Because no plants
grew at that time. Then we must
look for its origin elsewhere than in
plants. If coal be a vegetable product,
so is graphite. To say that
animal organism aided in the process
simply adds to the difficulty,
since it is carbon that makes the
organism and not the organism the
carbon. But suppose fossil plants
were found in graphite, would it be
any more evidence that they formed
it than that they formed clay or
sandrock in which they are found?
The simple fact that organic fossils
are found in carbon beds changed
to carbon affords no evidence that
these organisms made the beds.</p>

<p>We find vegetable remains in coal
seams just as we find them in any
other rock. A coal plant as a
lepidodendron, may begin in the
lower clay, and pierce through a
coal seam into the overhanging
shale and sandstone. In the first it
is a clay fossil, in the second a carbonaceous
fossil, and in the third a
silicious fossil. The fact is the
trunk of a tree in an upright position
in a coal bed, which is quite
common, proves that the coal formed
around it rapidly. It would require
forty feet of vegetable debris to
make five feet of carbon. Some
coal seams are 300 feet thick, which
would require at least 2,400 feet of
vegetable growth in its formation,
which is an impossibility. As a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
vegetable product coal would form
very slowly, but from the Vailan
system would require but a few
hours, or days at most, to lay it
down.</p>

<p>Plants found in coal burn with
difficulty, which ought not to be
true if they contained a resinous
sap, or bituminous matter. In many
instances you can find a dozen fossil
plants in the overlying clay to
where you can find one in coal.
They are clay fossils because they
are imbedded in clay, same as fossils
in coal are carbon because imbedded
in carbon.</p>

<p>If coal is compressed peat, as some
would have us believe, why do we
not find fibres running vertically
through it? You may examine peat
after a pressure of twenty tons to
the square inch has been exerted,
and yet the vertical structure of
the mass will be apparent. Since
we find abundance of rootlets running
in all directions, vertically as
well as horizontally in the under
clays of coal beds it is evident that
coal is not a metamorphosed peat.</p>

<p>Imagine an expanse of marshes
100,000 square miles in extent, covered
with calamites, ferns, sigillaria,
lepidodendra remaining motionless
for countless centuries, and then
suddenly sinking beneath the waves
of the sea in order to receive a sea-formed
bed for a covering; and in the
universal burial to preserve but a
few fossils, and they in a horizontal
position, while in the clays immediately
above and below the coal beds
they are found in profusion; that in
due time the vast area arose from
its baptism, and on the thin layer
of clay millions of the same plants
grew until they formed another bed
of coal, when it sinks again beneath
the waves, and this oscillation continued
until it had been buried
twenty, forty or one hundred times,
and you have the old theory of how
coal was formed.</p>

<p>But if the old theory concerning
the formation of coal is correct, how
did it occur that the earth in rising
out of the ocean stopped each time
in the right place for swamp vegetation
to accumulate? According
to the highest authority coal is not
formed from sea-plants, for they
cannot emit any considerable
amount of caloric, but it is the product
of land plants. Then why do
we find coal scattered over a vast
area of sea bottom?</p>

<p>The structure of continents show
that they have remained such from
their first formation. Some of the
geologic formations, as the Carboniferous-conglomerates,
took place all
over the earth at the same time.
How could this be except it came
from the Annular system?</p>

<p>Were we to have a shower of carbon
dust it would settle to the bottom
of the sea all over the irregularities
of the same. Then sand beds
accumulating for ages would settle
over it. These would form a greater
thickness in some places than in
others; hence a succeeding fall of
carbon settling upon the ocean floor
would not form a bed exactly parallel
with the first. This is precisely
what we find to be true in the carbon
deposits. The distance in coal
seams may vary from twenty feet in
one place to forty feet in another
place in the same neighborhood,
which is the result of irregularity
in the ocean floor.</p>

<p>Bowlders are found in coal seams
which means that coal beds have
been formed under water; and if a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
foreign bowlder that the coal seam
was formed at the bottom of the
ocean. Bowlders have been found
in the middle of coal seams with
glacial marks upon them, showing
that they have been dropped from
icebergs into the forming coal beds
at the bottom of the sea. Foreign
water-worn bowlders are frequently
found in coal beds.</p>

<p>Stratas of coal may be separated
by layers of clay not more than half
an inch in thickness; how could vegetation
take root in so thin a layer
of clay sufficient to form the overlying
coal seam of probably several
feet? Suppose a great carbon fund
should float from the Arctic ocean
into Hudson Bay. It would settle
upon an undulating bottom, and if a
flood of muddy water from the surrounding
rivers should empty into
the bay while the carbon bed was
forming, a thin clay bed would be
the result. This might continue as
long as the carbon was brought
from the Arctic regions.</p>

<p>The floating mass of primitive
carbon clouds after they entered
the atmosphere and floated away for
centuries, perhaps, toward the polar
regions in their efforts to reach the
earth, became a tissue of evolving
vegetable organisms and vegetable
forms. Take fresh soot from a furnace
soon as it is formed, subject it
to hot vapors from boiling waters
and store it away in an open vessel
of water, and you will soon see vegetable
and animal organisms start
into being. Then why not find organisms
in revolving soot clouds in
the Annular system?</p>

<p>Marine vegetation exists on the
sea bottom, and a carbon sediment
rapidly accumulating would certainly
involve it.</p>

<p>Under almost all the carbon veins
lies a deposit of fire clay. Strange
that adjoining a highly combustible
bed, a substance should be invariably
planted that is so refractory as
to be used for crucibles in fusing
almost every known metal! In this
bed lies involved a profuse marine
vegetation, and the preservation of
its delicate lineaments proves that
it was suddenly involved. It is
more generally present under coal
veins that are more distant from the
tropics, and <em>invariably</em> in the most
distant ones. The fire clay-dust
sublimed in the great telluric crucible
arose to commingle with primitive
vapors and returned with them.
When a carbon fall occurred the
clay matter being of greater specific
gravity was the first to find its way
to the ocean floor.</p>

<p>This fire clay is found under beds
of primitive graphite where no vegetation
is involved, and therefore
cannot be a vegetable distillation.
It is found where glacial action is
unknown, and cannot be mud pulverized
by moving ice. Every one
of the more than seventy coal seams
of the Nova Scotia regions has its
characteristic clay-bed. When we
see trees standing in and surrounded
by this clay we are forced to admit
a rapid accumulation.</p>

<p>Limestone is a deep sea formation
and the Vailan system demands
that standing trees should not be
found in it. Only such limestone
formation or strata as were deposited
as mechanical precipitation could
be formed in shallow waters, especially
in regions beyond the tropics.
A limestone stratum deposited
among shore deposits or continental
detritus points directly to Annular
origin and vegetable fossils will occur<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
in the upper clays. Here geologists
have an opportunity to prove
or disprove the Annular problem.</p>

<p>Coal and peat are not found in
the tropics where they ought to be
found if vegetation produced them.
And if they could be found there it
would sweep the Vailan system from
its foundations. They are found,
however, just where this system says
they must be found. Why is peat
found in the ocean, and in the
thousands of lakes and ponds where
no peat vegetation is now growing?
Suppose we find a peat bed forty
feet thick, it must have been at one
time a lake with forty feet of water,
and how did the peat begin to grow?
Peat forms slowly and the rains and
storms would have worked mud,
etc., more rapidly into it than the
peat would have filled it. It would
neither have grown from the top
nor from the bottom. The foundation
carbon fell from the Annular
fund.</p>


<h3>METAMORPHISM OF CARBON BEDS.</h3>

<p>When bituminous or lignitic coal,
or even peat is subjected to a sufficient
degree of heat it is converted
into hard coal and sometimes into
graphite. From this source some
conclude that anthracite and all
hard coals are metamorphosed beds
of soft carbon. But how about the
vast beds in aqueous crusts hundreds
of miles from any igneous
agencies? All anthracite coal
changed from bituminous coal will
contain a greater per cent. of ash
than the coal from which it is derived.
If it does not it is evidence
that it never was bituminous coal.</p>

<p>Let us suppose a heavy fall of
Annular carbon in the north Atlantic
ocean, and that the Appalachian
mountains were again under
the sea. The carbon carried by the
ocean currents southward would
fall to the sea bottom in the more
quiet waters. The heavy or anthracite
dust would reach the bottom in
deep waters where the lighter forms
would not. Before the Appalachian
upheaval, the eastern base of the
system was farther out in the sea,
and was in deeper waters than the
western. The constitution of the
coal itself, the condition of the sea
bottom (sloping from the coast to
the deep sea) point harmoniously to
the annular origin of the carbon
beds. The bituminous dust not being
able to directly settle with the
anthracite remained longer in suspension
which accounts for its
greater amount of ash. The farther
south it floated, the more impure
it became. The heaviest beds of
anthracite will be found in the
northern part of the great plateau,
and principally in British America
if the Vailan theory is true.</p>

<p>Fossil plants in coal are generally
mineralized charcoal, and are difficult
of combination. If the bed
was composed of vegetable production
the same difficulty would certainly
characterize the mass. Hence
the plant is simply a foreign body
in a bed of mineral carbon. Coal
seams have become so hard as to be
planed off by eroding forces directly
after being laid down, or before
heavy beds had accumulated over
them. Thus they could not have
been formed by vegetable peat.</p>


<h3>TERTIARY COALS.</h3>

<p>Extensive coal beds in Asia are
probably Tertiary, while the vast
carbon beds among the Rocky
Mountains, and underlying the vast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
plain to the west of these mountains,
were formed in the Tertiary
period. The Rocky Mountain plateau
on which the coal beds are
planted existed as a sea bottom over
which the waters from the Arctic
world rolled during the Tertiary
period. The Rocky Mountain region
was then sleeping in the sea.</p>

<p>The Tertiary beds reach from
Mexico to the Arctic ocean, proving
that currents ran toward the equator
along the valley of the McKenzie,
bearing into southern waters whatever
fell from the upper world. It
is thus easy to see how the vast expanse
of this western world became
the receptacle of Tertiary carbon.
Finding no Tertiary coals on the
Eastern border of our continent
we are led to believe that a narrow
continent stretched from America
to Europe across the present bed of
the Atlantic and hindered the flow
of carbon along the Atlantic seaboard.
It is now conceded by geologists
that such an isthmus of land
reached from Newfoundland to the
shores of Europe during the Tertiary
period. This being true a
vast fund of carbon must lie at the
bottom of the North Atlantic.</p>

<p>If these later coals had been
formed out of vegetation growing
in great continental swamps, the
same opportunity was afforded by
the southern sea borders for this
swamp vegetation. And so from
Long Island to the Rio Grande.
Why then do we not find it
if coal is of vegetable origin? If
the vast fund of the lignitic coals
is a vegetable production it was
present in the Tertiary atmosphere
as a deadly poison. But at that
time both land and sea were full of
air-breathing mammals and monsters
showing conclusively that it
was not there in such a condition.</p>


<h3>DEDUCTIONS.</h3>

<p>1. The plant when subjected to
a proper mode of distillation is
made to yield carbon in various allotropic
forms. So of any mineral
that has carbon in its constitution.
These forms of carbon were placed
in the crust of the earth after the
primitive fires had died out.</p>

<p>2. All such primitive distillations
existed in the atmosphere of the
incandescent earth.</p>

<p>3. This matter as it declined and
mingled with the atmosphere in
after ages, changed from the ring to
the belt form, and overcanopied the
earth and fell largely in regions
outside the tropics.</p>

<p>4. The heavier forms of carbon
fell largely in the earlier ages;
though all sections of the system
must have had some of each form.</p>

<p>5. All ages were more or less
characterized by carbon falls, and
no age could be exclusively carboniferous.</p>

<p>6. Carbon falling directly into
the ocean would separate into heavier
and lighter forms and settle
accordingly in higher or lower elevations
of sea bottom, thus explaining
why different forms of coal are
found in the same proximate horizon.</p>

<p>7. The earliest or heavier forms
are free from organic remains, and
must therefore be a primitive distillation.
The other carbon beds by
their associated strata; by their involved
vegetation and other organisms;
by accompanying clay-partings;
by involved glacial drift; by
latitudinal gradation in quantity of
ash and specific gravity; by characteristic
absence from the tropics and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
the heavy deposits in higher latitudes;
by synchronous formation in
all continents; by their evident formation
in the very lap and bosom of
the glacier and in ice and flood; by
the fact that they are bituminous,
oily hydro-carbons, and by a multitude
of inconsistencies and impossibilities
involved in the vegetation
theory, have been shown to be actual
sedimentary deposits, and therefore
a primitive product.</p>

<p>Since then there is not a feature
connected with the formation of coal
that is not readily explained by the
primitive carbon theory; not one
that philosophic law does not resolve
into harmony with Annular
declension without even the show of
conflict; and since vegetarians are
forever stumbling upon inexplicable
difficulties—bowlders, pebbles, undulations,
slopes, ripple-marks, clay-partings,
cannel-coal inseparably
joined with bituminous coal, anthracites
with less amount of ash, marine
impurities, carbon planted in Archaean
beds, air-breathing animals
among Tertiary coals, carbon
dredged from the ocean, dug from
the frozen world, and innumerable
other objections over which they can
not climb, the vegetation theory can
not be true.</p>


<h3>ANNULAR DOWNFALL IN THE TERTIARY
OCEAN OF THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE.</h3>

<p>If the Vailian theory claims are
valid the beds in the Rocky Mountain
Tertiary must present the following
features: The Cretaceous
period having been brought to a
close by a down-rush of waters and
snows in the northern hemisphere,
a stream of water pouring southward
must to a great extent have
been a fresh-water current, and
those deposits in the extreme northern
beds of the Rocky Mountain
region must be largely fresh-water
accumulations. Those in the middle
of this region must be to a less
extent fresh-water; perhaps sometimes
fresh and again marine, owing
to changes in currents, etc., and
the two be commingled, while in
the southern part the beds must
be almost exclusively marine. Fortunately
for the Vailian theory these
demands are fully met. The waters
of this vast region communicated
with the Arctic ocean, probably by
way of the present depression in
British America, along the valley of
the McKenzie river, while south it
communicated with the Gulf of
Mexico.</p>

<p>Here was a sea forty times larger
than Lake Erie. Where did the
water come from that made the
northern part fresh, the middle part
brackish and the southern portion
marine? The Tertiary of the Pacific
Coast is marine; so is a larger portion
of the Atlantic border. Doubtless
Davis Strait poured a volume
of fresh-water from the polar world
into the Atlantic, for there is the
same commingling of marine and
fresh-water shells on the northeast
coast, while in the northern part
they are exclusively fresh-water
species. Rivers could not have
done this, for all the rivers from
Delaware Bay around the coast of
the Gulf of Mexico were not sufficient
to lay down fresh-water Tertiary.
Admit that the vast polar
ocean of the Tertiary period was a
body of fresh-water, and all difficulties
disappear.</p>

<p>Geologists admit that in the Tertiary
period mountains were made
on every continent, that there was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
world-wide disturbance of strata,
and the most complete extermination
of species on record. The
Cretaceous world was swept by a
mighty cataclysmic wave, and its
animals were buried in the detrital
mass swept from the land into the
seas and formed the lower Eocene
beds. Nothing of which we can
conceive could do this but a downpour
of Annular waters. One-third
of North America, a great part of
Northern Europe, nearly all of Siberia,
much of China, and other
parts of Asia were apparently synchronously
submerged beneath
<em>fresh-water</em>.</p>

<p>The ocean of fresh-water proves
the augmentation of snows from the
great super-aerial fund. The Cretaceous
age closed by excessive and
unusual refrigeration. The transported
blocks of stone found in the
Upper Cretaceous and Lower Tertiary
point to a northern origin. The
evidence is overwhelmingly in favor
of an Annular fall of waters in the
north polar world at that time.</p>

<p>Existing continents were submerged
under Cretaceous waters.
The Rocky Mountains, Andes, Alps
and Himalayas were either unborn
or in their infant stage. But some
mighty barrier was raised that
rolled the Cretaceous waters southward,
and made an isolated fresh-water
ocean on the north. It was
the great Atlantic plateau reaching
from Newfoundland to Ireland,
which is known by actual soundings
and other evidence to be a submerged
table land. It was raised
from the deep at this very time and
stood for uncounted milleniums as
dry land.</p>

<p>Suppose an ice cap 5000 feet thick
should suddenly cover the Arctic
world. It would press that part of
the globe inward and downward
upon itself even if the planet were
solid to the centre. It would render
the rocks plastic and they would be
pushed under the continents causing
the crust of the earth to rise into
mountains in many places. Just
what occurred in Cretaceous and
Tertiary times.</p>

<p>We can trace the shore-line of an
almost limitless fresh-water sea
around the whole hemisphere in
Tertiary times, showing that the
Arctic ocean was a wide expanse of
fresh-waters. This leads to the positive
and permanent establishment
of the Vailian or Annular theory.</p>

<h3>THE LAST ADVANCE OF GLACIERS.</h3>

<p>The last downfall of exterior
vapors was at the time of Noah, and
produced the deluge. These vapors
naturally gravitated toward the
polar regions and falling there as
snows would accumulate as glaciers,
their magnitude and extent corresponding
with the amount of falling
snows. It is evident if there ever
was an Eden climate upon the earth
its destruction was brought about
by a change of climate. If the
Deluge was a collapse of the last
remnant of upper waters the latter
must have begun to fall in polar
regions many centuries previous.</p>

<p>The Eden world suffered a change
of climate during the Adamic age,
for the race that dwelt naked in
Eden became clothed in the skins
of animals. If this infant race
dwelt naked the climate was warm.
If afterward it became necessary to
be clothed with the skins of animals
it certainly had become cold. If<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
the cold increased it was probably
caused by the fall of snow in polar
regions. The physical condition of
the antedeluvians and their environment
depended on the conditions of
the upper vapors. Hence, polar
glaciers began to advance in Edenic
times.</p>

<p>Glaciers advanced slowly, and are
still advancing. Eight hundred
years ago Greenland was not the
frigid land it now is. The Icelanders
and the Northmen sailed through
northern seas in the interest of
commerce where now our hardiest
seamen with iron-clad vessels
scarcely dare to venture. They
pushed forward commercial enterprises
into lands that are now inhospitable
and uninhabited.</p>

<p>The present glaciation of polar
worlds is but the result of the last
declension of outward vapors. The
great ice caps of polar regions are
moving toward the equator and are
constantly diminishing. It is possible
that we are approaching a day
when the last ice berg will be borne
toward the tropics, and the last
glacier will melt, and a more genial
climate pervade the greater portion
of the earth.</p>


<h3>LONGEVITY OF THE ANCIENTS.</h3>

<p>According to the biblical account
people lived to be 800 and 900
years old. This was principally
because of the modification of solar
energy. Man’s physical environments
impelled long life; and his
longevity diminished immediately
after the upper deep fell and the
sun began to pour his beams upon
the race; his environment evidently
changed with that event. In a few
generations after the flood man died
at the age of 120 or 100 years, and
finally at three score and ten.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Dr. Bowers</span>: I have read
with much interest thy compendium
of “The Earth’s Annular System,”
as published by me in 1886. A synopsis
of that work can give but a
meager idea of the grand conception
of the annular evolution of the
earth. “The Annular Theory” stands
on the immutable truth that worlds
evolve according to invariable law.</p>

<p>This compels us to admit that all
worlds are made alike, in the general
changes they undergo. Just as
a bud evolves into a flower of the
most delicate construction and architectural
order, so a world launched
from the same designing Hand must
move in the same line of eternal
order, and under the law of natural
uniformity develop and grow into a
completed world.</p>

<p>This also leads us to the conclusion
that if one world possess at any
time an annular system, then all
worlds must possess a similar appendage
during some period of their
existence. Consequently that simple
fact that the planet Saturn possesses
at this time an annular or ring system
is proof that the earth once had
a similar appendage. For we must
either admit this truth or we must
admit that the planet Saturn has
not evolved thus far along a line of
nature’s uniformity, but is today a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
victim of accidental conditions. This
law refuses to admit.</p>

<p>But “The Annular Theory” does
not rest on these grounds alone. A
universe of <em>invariable order</em> pronounces
it an immutable truth. The
judgment of the chemist and philosopher
is positive that a rotating
world cannot pass from the molten
state to the present condition of the
earth without undergoing annular
changes.</p>

<p>Since the publication of “The
Earth’s Annular System” I have had
opportunities of examining more
minutely the subjects treated of
therein and have secured the most
overwhelming evidence that the
theory there proposed is in the main
correct and will stand the test of all
time. I have found, outside the
realm of physical science, the most
positive evidence that primitive man
actually saw at least two rings revolving
about the earth, named
them and worshiped them as gods.
These relics I have rescued from the
wreck of ages, and <em>with</em> these I will
prove the fact that this earth once
had a complex system of Saturn-like
rings.</p>

<p>Thus in the end the geologist and
astronomer will be compelled to admit
its truthfulness whether they
desire to or not. I have found
among the ruins of ancient Egypt,
Babylonia, India and China annular
fossils, the identification of which
settles at once and forever this great
question.</p>

<p>Again, I need not point the geologist
to the mysteries of the glacial
epochs, which grow darker and
darker as he looks for a competent
cause for their production. He
must know that the great ocean of
vapors that hovered for unknown
time over the earth in the loftiest
heights of the atmosphere, such as
now are seen on two of our neighbor
planets, could not have fallen to the
earth without covering it in the
higher latitudes with measureless
masses of snow, resulting in excessive
refrigeration. I need but point
him to the fact, proven by the coast
surveys of the world, that the oceans
have encroached upon the land to
such an extent since the last glacial
epoch that they stand now fully
thirty fathoms deeper than they did
in pre-glacial times. I need only
point him to that grand clock-work
of worlds shining from the firmament—every
scintillating point,
every rolling sun, is a witness of
nature’s eternal order, and proclaims
that uniformitarian principle of
world evolution, by which the philosophic
investigator must stand. The
geologist must build on this rock of
<em>uniformity</em> in the evolution of worlds.
The earth has evolved along <em>this</em>
line, and the wreck of annular conditions
is seen on every page of its
rocky volume.</p>

<p>In the year 1875 I published a
little volume entitled “The Earth’s
Aqueous Ring.” In it I stated my
convictions, and gave reasons therefor,
that all the glacial periods the
world ever saw were produced by
supra-aerial vapors descending from
an annular system that revolved
about the earth from the remotest
geologic ages to the flood of Noah,
which was itself produced by the
fall of the last remnants of those
upper waters. These claims I am
fully prepared to substantiate, whatever
opposition may be brought
against them.</p>
